## Cycles-Python-Fundamentals-3
In this repository you can find 12 solved and simple exercises carried out through `<link>` : <https://replit.com/~> which are made using the Python programming language.

The exercises are taken from a document sent by the teacher.

## Main.py
In order to get started, it is important to clarify the order in which the exercises would be performed. For this, a main document "1.0_main.py" was established, in which you can find the function to execute the document with the exercise you want only taking into account the number of each one.
In this link you can find the code of the main document in detail.

`<link>` : <(https://github.com/NathhRangel4113/Cycles-Python-Fundamentals-3/blob/main/main.py)>

It should be noted that the same document contains ALL the exercises that will be explained below:

## Exercises:
#### 30. Print all the multiples of 3 that are between 1 and 100.
#### 31. Print odd numbers between 0 and 100.
#### 32. Print the pair numbers between 0 and 100.
#### 33. Write a Python program that prints the numbers 1 through 3 on the screen.
#### 34. Write a Python program that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 on the screen.
#### 35. Write a Python program that prints squares of numbers to the screen from 1 to 30.
#### 36. Write a Python program that adds the squares of the first hundred natural numbers, showing the result on the screen.
#### 37. Write a Python program that reads an integer from the keyboard and performs the sum of the following hundred numbers, displaying the result on the screen (eg: the user types 5, 5+6+7+8+ must be added... until that completes one hundred numbers)
#### 38. Find the factorial number of a number entered by the user.
#### 39. Write a program that reads temperatures in degrees Fahrenheit and converts them to degrees Celsius. The program will end when it reads a temperature value equal to 999. The formula c = 5/9(f - 32)
#### 40. Print prime numbers up to a number entered by the user.
#### 41. Show on the screen the multiplication table that the user wants
#### 42. Enter a set of positive numbers. Calculate and write its average knowing that a value less than 0 will be entered to indicate the end of the set of numbers.
#### 43. Given two natural numbers, the first less than the second, generate and display all the numbers between them in ascending sequence.
#### 44. Write an algorithm that shows the values of all the dominoes in an ordered way: 0-0 0-1 1-1 ...}

## Structure:
First of all we define each of the exercises proposed in the miscellaneous of exercises, then below we can find the structure of the code that will allow us to execute each one of them according to the choice of the end user.

## Defining
In the definition we can find each of the exercises (including the previous ones) already defined as a function to be used later, specifically we can see a function of each exercise and the code of each one under the comment with the number.

## Running
In the executing section we can find a simple code that allows us to execute each of the exercises defined as functions previously, this allows us to have a continuous visualization of the exercises without the need to re-execute, since it has a "While" cycle system "that allows us to have this facility. Additionally, the program will end when the number 99 is entered.
